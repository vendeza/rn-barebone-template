#Distribute an app using TestFlight

###<b>Step 1:</b> Archive app
First [prepare your app for distribution](./PrepareForDistribution.md) and then create an [archive app](./CreateArchiveFile.md).

###<b>Step 2:</b> Validate and upload the archive to App Store Connect
Validate the archive of your app and if it passes App Store Connect tests, upload it to App Store Connect.

###<b>Step 3:</b> In App Store Connect, view build details and add metadata to the app version
Go to Viewing builds and file sizes and View and edit app information in App Store Connect Help.

Important: After your app is uploaded or released, you can’t change some of this metadata, so it’s important to choose your settings carefully. To learn which properties can be edited at any time in App Store Connect, go to Required, localizable, and editable properties.

###<b>Step 4:</b> Invite internal and external testers
To add, invite, and view testers in App Store Connect, go to TestFlight beta testing overview in App Store Connect Help. If you invite external testers, your app is submitted to Beta App Review.

####<b>Tip:</b> To test the variants that the App Store builds before you release your app, invite internal testers (your team’s App Store Connect users) only and download the variants using TestFlight.

###<b>Step 5:</b> Users download TestFlight and accept your invitations
Testers install the free TestFlight app on their devices. Then testers use TestFlight to redeem invitations, install your app, send feedback, and get updates. Testers download and install thinned variants of your app.
